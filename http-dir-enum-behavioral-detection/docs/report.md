# SOC Incident Analysis: Automated Detection & Triage of HTTP Directory Enumeration

## 📑 Project Overview
[cite_start]This report documents the end-to-end detection, analysis, and triage of suspected directory enumeration activity within HTTP access logs[cite: 5]. [cite_start]Using Splunk, I engineered a high-fidelity detection framework to identify automated reconnaissance tools like **DirBuster**[cite: 7].

## 📊 Key Results
* [cite_start]**Classification**: Suspicious Reconnaissance[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Primary Offender**: IP `192.168.203.63` exhibited the highest scanning characteristics and matched known threat intelligence signatures[cite: 107, 110].
* [cite_start]**Efficiency**: The detection logic reduces **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** by surfacing aggressive IPs exceeding 10k requests.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* [cite_start]**Splunk Index**: `http` [cite: 17]
* [cite_start]**Detection Logic**: Multi-vector triage correlating volume, URI diversity, HTTP methods, and status codes[cite: 97].
* [cite_start]**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1595 - Active Scanning[cite: 425].
